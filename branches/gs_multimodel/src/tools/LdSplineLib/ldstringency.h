/*
** example file of UDF (user definable functions) that are dynamicly loaded
** into the standard mysqld core.
**
** The functions name, type and shared library is saved in the new system
** table 'func'.  To be able to create new functions one must have write
** privilege for the database 'mysql'.	If one starts MySQL with
** --skip-grant, then UDF initialization will also be skipped.
**
** Syntax for the new commands are:
** create function <function_name> returns {string|real|integer}
**		  soname <name_of_shared_library>
** drop function <function_name>
**
** Each defined function may have a xxxx_init function and a xxxx_deinit
** function.  The init function should alloc memory for the function
** and tell the main function about the max length of the result
** (for string functions), number of decimals (for double functions) and
** if the result may be a null value.
**
** If a function sets the 'error' argument to 1 the function will not be
** called anymore and mysqld will return NULL for all calls to this copy
** of the function.
**
** All strings arguments to functions are given as string pointer + length
** to allow handling of binary data.
** Remember that all functions must be thread safe. This means that one is not
** allowed to alloc any global or static variables that changes!
** If one needs memory one should alloc this in the init function and free
** this on the __deinit function.
**
** Note that the init and __deinit functions are only called once per
** SQL statement while the value function may be called many times
**
** Function 'metaphon' returns a metaphon string of the string argument.
** This is something like a soundex string, but it's more tuned for English.
**
** Function 'myfunc_double' returns summary of codes of all letters
** of arguments divided by summary length of all its arguments.
**
** Function 'myfunc_int' returns summary length of all its arguments.
**
** Function 'sequence' returns an sequence starting from a certain number.
** On the end is a couple of functions that converts hostnames to ip and
** vice versa.
**
** A dynamicly loadable file should be compiled shared.
** (something like: gcc -shared -o my_func.so myfunc.cc).
** You can easily get all switches right by doing:
** cd sql ; make udf_example.o
** Take the compile line that make writes, remove the '-c' near the end of
** the line and add -shared -o udf_example.so to the end of the compile line.
** The resulting library (udf_example.so) should be copied to some dir
** searched by ld. (/usr/lib ?)
** If you are using gcc, then you should be able to create the udf_example.so
** by simply doing 'make udf_example.so'.
**
** After the library is made one must notify mysqld about the new
** functions with the commands:
**
   CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION dpvar RETURNS INTEGER SONAME "dpvar.so"

	SELECT pos1, dpvar(pos2, dprime, 0.25), 0.25 FROM snptest.testtable GROUP BY pos1;
**
** After this the functions will work exactly like native MySQL functions.
** Functions should be created only once.
**
** The functions can be deleted by:
**
** DROP FUNCTION dpvar;
**
** The CREATE FUNCTION and DROP FUNCTION update the func@mysql table. All
** Active function will be reloaded on every restart of server
** (if --skip-grant-tables is not given)
**
** If you ge problems with undefined symbols when loading the shared
** library, you should verify that mysqld is compiled with the -rdynamic
** option.
**
** If you can't get AGGREGATES to work, check that you have the column
** 'type' in the mysql.func table.  If not, run 'mysql_fix_privilege_tables'.
**
