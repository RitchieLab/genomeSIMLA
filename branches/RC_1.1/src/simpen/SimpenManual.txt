1.  Introduction

The program simpen combines a penetrance model generator with a genotype
data simulator.  Simpen can be used to evolve a new penetrance model only or
it can use that penetrance model to generate the simulated genotype data as
specified in the configuration file.  Alternatively, simpen can accept a 
previously defined model and generate the genotype data.

The program utilizes a genetic algorithm to evolve a penetrance
model meeting the specifications of the user.  The program minimizes the 
marginal penetrance variance to simulate a model with minimal main effects
while also optimizing heritability, table variance, and average marginal penetrance
as selected by the user.

Simpen is linked to a data simulator that will use the model evolved by simpen
to create data files of individuals with genotypes.  This program also accepts 
a datasim file that lists the parameters for running the simulator.  
The examples provide additional information on these options.


2. Examples

    Simpen takes 2 arguments.  The first is the name of the configuration file
    and the second is the base name to use in creating output files.  Sample 
    files are at the end of this document.  Simpen automatically determines
    whether the input file is a file for producing models or whether the file
    specifies the production of data only.

3.  Input files

The user must provide a configuration file listing the parameters for use in the 
program.  Parameters should be capitalized as shown below.  Most parameters have
default values as indicated.  All parameters should list the parameter name
followed by one or more spaces and then the parameter values.  Each parameter
should be on its own line.

---------     ------    -----------------
SEED          Time       Seed for random generator

LOCI          2          Number of loci in model

FREQ          0.8 0.2    These are the frequencies of the alleles. A 
                         locus only has two alleles in the current 
                         version of simpen.  The user can specify 
                         different allele frequencies for each locus.  
                         If there are more loci than specified 
                         frequencies, all extra loci have the same 
                         frequencies as the first listed.  In the 
                         example all 4 loci would have allele 
                          frequencies set to 0.7 and 0.3. 

TABLEVAR      0.1        Target table variance.

USETABLEVAR   ON         When set to ON, table variance will be used
                         as part of the fitness function.  Use "OFF"
                         to ignore table variance.

MARGVAR       0.00001    Marginal variance target always used in fitness
                         function.
                                    
MARGWEIGHT    5          Weight given in fitness function to 
                         difference between model's marginal variance
                         and the target marginal variance.
                                    
PENTARGET     0.0        Marginal penetrance target used in fitness
                         function if this parameter is included
                         in the configuration file.  Otherwise,
                         the marginal penetrance will not be 
                         included in the fitness function.

GEN           5000       Maximum number of generations.  The program
                         will also terminate if a solution has
                         met the fitness criteria.

SUBMODELS     OFF        When on, the program calculates the
                         statistics for submodels contained within
                         the best model found.  For model ABC,
                         it would calculate the statistics for
                         AB, AC, and BC.

VERBOSE       OFF        Reported output will include additional
                         information such as the marginal penetrances
                         marginal variance, table variance, 
                         heritability, and fitness for each model.
                                    
UPDATE        100        Interval at which the current best model
                         fitness is displayed.

SIMTYPE      prob        Must be either 'pop' or 'prob'.  'pop' 
                         means simulation will be population-
                         based while 'prob' will be probability-
                         based.

                         will be produced.  Only the .out, .datasim, and
                         .loc files will be produced.  If set >= 1, then
                         .txt files are produced with the number of sets
                         specified here for each model.

4. Fitness function 

The genetic algorithm uses a fitness function to evolve a model.  The function
evaluates the fitness of each model in the population.  The fitness is 
dependent on the parameters supplied in the configuration file.  Marginal 
penetrance variance and heritability always affect fitness.  Table variance
and marginal penetrance target only affect when set in configuration file.
Maximum fitness is 1.0.  The genetic algorithm terminates when it finds a model
with fitness = 1.0 or the maximum number of generations is reached.

Marginal Penetrance Variance -- If the marginal penetrance variance is greater
than the MARGVAR parameter in the configuration file, fitness is reduced by the 
weighted difference of the two.

(|Marginal Penetrance Variance - MARGVAR|) * MARGWEIGHT


Heritability -- If the model's heritability is more than .002 different
from the HERIT parameter, then the fitness is reduced by the weighted 
difference of the two when this parameter has been set.

(|Heritability - HERIT|) * HERITWEIGHT


Odds Ratio -- If the model's odds ratio is more than .05 different
from the ODDSRATIO parameter, then the fitness is reduced by the weighted
difference of the two when this parameter has been set.

(|Odds Ratio - ODDSRATIO|) * ODDSWEIGHT


Target marginal penetrance -- If the PENTARGET parameter is set in the 
configuration file and the average marginal penetrance is more than .003
different from the PENTARGET parameter, the fitness is reduced by the
difference of the two.

(|Average Marginal Penetrance - PENTARGET|) 


Table cell variance -- If the USETABLEVAR parameter is set to on and the 
table cell variance is less than TABLEVAR, fitness is reduced by the difference
of the two.

TABLEVAR - table cell variance



5. Genotype data simulation

Simpen can simulate genotype data using probability or population based 
approaches.  In the probability based approach, the user indicates the 
number of affected and unaffected individuals desired.  The program randomly
determines each genotype based on the allele frequencies and compares the 
individual's genotype at the model loci against the penetrance table.  
Affected and unaffected individuals are selected as needed.

In a population based approach an initial population is generated without
regard to affection status.  The program creates a map based on the parameters
specified and the population undergoes a user-specified number of generations.
The program produces each succeeding generation by randomly selecting 
individuals and crossing them.  The individuals undergo crossover and each 
pass a chromosome to the offspring.  Affection status is assigned after
the last generation.



6.  Screen Output

While processing, the program displays progress to standard output.  If VERBOSE
is off, the only number of generations and current fitness of the best model
are shown as below:

 Count        Fitness
---------------------
   [0]      0.0359932
 [100]       0.724547
 [200]       0.831487
 [300]       0.911068
 [400]       0.954538
 [500]              1
 
If VERBOSE is on, standard output shows the marginal penetrance 
variance, table cell variance, heritability, average marginal penetrance, and
fitness as below:

7.  File Output

The program produces multiple output files. The files have the extensions .out, 
.smod, .datasim, .txt and .loc.  The names are dependent on the optional second 
command line argument to the program.  The default names are models.out, models.smod, 
and models.datasim.  The .txt and .loc files are only produced if the program
simulates genotype data.


.out file -- Displays the models produced by the program.  It always displays 
penetrance values for the genotypes of the model as below:

-----------------------------------
Model #1
-----------------------------------
AABBCC 0.084
AABBCc 0.050
AABBcc 0.107
AABbCC 0.055
AABbCc 0.343
AABbcc 0.000
AAbbCC 0.112
AAbbCc 0.078


If VERBOSE is on, it also displays the marginal penetrances and other information
on the model.
