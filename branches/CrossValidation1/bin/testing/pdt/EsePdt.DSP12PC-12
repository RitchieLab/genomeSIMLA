/******************** Basic Settings
 * Describe the type of models of interest. Models consist on 1 or more SNPs.
 * The minimum number of SNPs in a model to be investigated. Valid settings: 1..COMBO_END
COMBO_START            1
 *  The maximum number of SNPs to be considered. Valid settings: COMBO_START...
COMBO_END              3
 *  If the data has little or no missing data, it will run faster by using the overall threshold
USE_MODEL_THRESHOLD    ON
 *  The value used to indicate that an individual is affected
AFFECTED_VALUE         2
 *  The value used to indicate that an individual is unaffected
UNAFFECTED_VALUE       1
 *  All other individuals will be considered to be of unknown status and will not contribute to the calculations


/****************** Input format
 * PEDIGREE   - For PDT anayses there is only one format supported
INPUTFORMAT            PEDIGREE
 *  The name of the input file where your SNP data is to be found. This file must be space delimited
INPUTFILE              DSPs.Model2PC.12.ped
 *  There is only one Pedigree analysis currently available
ANALYSISSTYLE          PDT
 *  Turn On/Off Triad expansion
EXPAND_TRIADS          Yes
 *  Experimental Optimization. Valid Optimization settings (0.1 - 0.9). 
DOPTIMIZATION			0.10
 *  Matched Odds Verbose On/Off. Turning this on generates the table of pair contributions
VERBOSE_MATCHED_ODDS_RATIO Off
 *  Evaluation Verbose Yes/No
VERBOSE_EVALUATION     No


/****************** Reporting
 * Reports are set up in the form: REPORT_NAME.EXT Each type or report has it's own different extension.
 * Any report whose extension is STDOUT will be redirected to standard out instead of written to a file.
 * By default, REPORT_NAME is just the name of the configuration file
 *REPORT_NAME MyReportName
EXT_DISTRIBUTION       pdist      //This is where the distribution of the p-tests is written
EXT_REPORT             STDOUT     //This is where the final results are written
EXT_PEDIGREE          pedigree      //Pedigree related errors and notes are logged here


/****************** Permutation Tests
 * Number of permutation runs to be executed. 1000 is recommended.
PTEST_COUNT            100
 * The seed associated with the tests. Each test gets a new seed
PTEST_SEED             333
 * Reporting can be done based on a p-value threshold. Any model whose significance exceeds this value will be reported.
PVAL_THRESHOLD         0.05
