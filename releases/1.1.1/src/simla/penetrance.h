1-5      0.1						// The values in this example were useful for debugging but are probably

Important notes: 
1. DO NOT have any line starting with whitespace. The reader expects the first character to be 0-9.
2. Fields are seperated by one or more whitespaces.
3. The loci interactions/combinations are one continous string with "-" seperating the individual loci.
4. The loci combinations don't have to be in any particular order. i.e. it doesn't matter if 1-2-5 comes before or after 2-3-4
5. Within one combination the loci must be ordered. i.e. 2-4-5 is the only acceptable format of this 3-loci interaction. 4-2-5 for example is not acceptable.
6. The last line of the control file is a newline by itself.

//	to get things started:
// 1. Declare "Penetrance-Class" variable.
// 2. Call Penetrance::init("name-of-your-control-file-here")
// 3. It will call an external function "generate_genotypes(int number_of_loci, int test_sample_size, int *test_list)"
//	- the memory for test_list has been allocated. The generate_genotypes() function is supposed to 
//	fill in the list with "test_sample_size" RANDOM genotypes like they are likely to occur in the
//	general population. See "void generate_genotypes(int num_of_loci, int n, int *list)" as example. Each bi-allelic 
//	locus (the only type we consider) has 3 possible genotypes. So with n-loci we have a total of 3^n
//	distinct disease genotypes, coded as integers 0 .. (3^n - 1).
// 4. To get penetrance values call; double Penetrance::fx(int individuals-genotype)
//	The argument "individuals-genotype" is an integer coded as in the generate_genotypes() function.
//	The return value is the penetrance value in (0,1). Usually you would compare this value
//	to a unifom random number on [0,1] to decide affection status. If random less than penetrance => affected
//	else unaffected.
